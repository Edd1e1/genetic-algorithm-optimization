# Genetic Algorithm for Optimization (C++)

This repository contains a C++ implementation of a Genetic Algorithm (GA)
designed for solving continuous optimization problems.

## Overview
The project focuses on core evolutionary computation concepts, including
population-based search, genetic operators, and fitness-based selection.
The implementation emphasizes clarity and algorithmic correctness.

## Implemented Features
- Population initialization
- Fitness evaluation
- Selection mechanisms
- Crossover and mutation operators
- Elitism to preserve high-quality solutions
- Multiple independent runs for statistical evaluation

## Purpose
- Practice evolutionary algorithm design
- Understand convergence behavior of Genetic Algorithms
- Analyze the impact of parameters such as population size and mutation rate

## Technologies
- C++
- Standard library random number generation
- Numerical optimization techniques

This project was developed for academic purposes in the context of evolutionary
algorithms and optimization.
